Real-time TTP monitoring can block 72hr campaigns and app-specific social engineering at scale.",

It detects SQL injection, command injection, XSS vulnerabilities, includes JWT manipulation for authentication testing, and integrates with Swagger.IO for API endpoint testing[1].\n\n**JS Vulnerability Detector** scans JavaScript dependencies against the CVE database in real-time as pages load, identifying known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries with multiple remediation options including script blocking and patch application[1].\n\n**StorageAce** specializes in cookie and storage management with advanced JWT token handling, enabling extraction and analysis of authentication tokens from browser storage and precise cookie blocking with domain, name, and value filters[1].\n\n**Adblock Plus** remains widely adopted with 10M+ users and a 4.4/5 Chrome Web Store rating[3]. Beyond ad blocking, it blocks video/image ads, banners, pop-ups, malware, and prevents cookies from extracting user data[3].\n\n## Privacy & Anti-Tracking Performance\n\nRecent research found **no statistically significant reduction in ad-blocking or anti-tracking effectiveness** between MV3 and MV2 extensions[10]. MV3 extensions actually improved anti-tracking by blocking 1.8 more tracking scripts per website on average than MV2 counterparts[10].\n\n## Critical Security Threats\n\n**Malicious extensions pose severe risks:**\n\n- **Stanley MaaS** ($2,000-$6,000 subscription tiers) guarantees Chrome Web Store publication for phishing extensions that overlay full-screen iframes while keeping legitimate URLs visible in the address bar[2][12]. Operators can enable/disable hijacking rules on demand and push browser notifications to lure users[2].\n\n- **Amazon Ads Blocker** (uploaded January 19, 2026) and similar extensions disguised as note-taking utilities hijack affiliate links, steal data, and exfiltrate ChatGPT authentication tokens[6].\n\n- **NexShield extension** (since removed) was a modified uBlock Origin Lite clone that downloaded Windows RATs onto domain-joined machines after fake browser crash alerts[4].\n\n- **Five coordinated extensions** (DataByCloud 2, Tool Access 11, DataByCloud Access, Data By Cloud 1, Software Access) downloaded by 2,300 users targeted enterprise HR/ERP platforms, stealing cookies, blocking incident response, and preventing password changes[8].\n\n- **16 malicious ChatGPT-themed extensions**",
